Bullets and Beats was created for a game design module (NM3216) in National University of Singapore by Spencer Tan, Ng Hui Ren, Ng Jing Heng, Kelly Lim and Rahmani Nitiyudo. The gameplay involves collecting "Beats" as a form of ammunition to defeat your enemies. "Beats" spawn according to the beat of the music played, and collecting them at the right time will give extra benefits.

Feel free to download and give the game a try! Feedback is very much appreciated and can be left on the GitHub page via *_"Issues"_*.
